# Graphic User Interface integrated into Database
Repository to share a GUI integrated with a database

### Context

It starts creating a database in PostgreSQL in order to receive data about some products and their respective prices.

I did not use real products and prices considering that the focus of this project is to join a graphic user interface and a database rather than bring their real information, so that was the reason why the database was filled with random values for prices and generic names for products.

The code was developed in Python programming language, and the object-oriented programming paradigm made it possible to create an object which can contain data from the database and CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update and Delete) besides turning the code programming easier and more understandable.

Finally, a graphic interface was created to present to the user all products and their respective prices, besides permits to the user to execute CRUD operations from itself and commit it in the database
